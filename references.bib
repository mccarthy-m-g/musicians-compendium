  abstract = {Hearing tests of the peripheral auditory system are well established and the pure-tone audiogram is generally regarded as the screening test of choice in adults. It allows the distinction to be made between conductive, i.e., outer- and middle-ear, and sensorineural, i.e., cochlear, hearing loss, and also to describe the configuration of the hearing thresholds in terms of severity and the frequency affected. Electrophysiologic testing with auditory potentials, e.g., the auditory brainstem response, can identify sites of lesion in the eighth nerve, brainstem, and more centrally. However, it is only in the last two decades that a battery of central auditory tests has been established that can probe the central pathways in more details, i.e., when the pure-tone audiogram may be normal, and yet the patient still has symptoms of hearing dysfunction.},

The opportunity afforded by the preparation of this second edition has allowed us to bring our discussion up to date by including those new insights that have arisen from the work of many dedicated researchers over the past decade. We have also taken the opportunity to revise our presentation of some aspects of the subject to make it more general and, we hope, more immediately accessible. We have, of course, corrected any errors that have come to our attention, and we express our thanks to those friends who pointed out such defects in the early printings of the first edition. We hope that this book will continue to serve as a guide, both to those undertaking research in the field and to those who simply have a deep interest in the subject. June 1991 N.H.F and T.D.R.},

  abstract = {This book, originally developed under National Science Foundation grant support, was written to bridge academic disciplines and areas of practice that include music production, audio engineering for theatre and film, and computer science. Apart from the first and the last chapters, each chapter is divided into three sections. The first section covers general concepts, the second discusses applications, and the third delves into the mathematics and algorithms that underpin digital audio processing. It is not intended that a single course would cover all the material in this book. Rather, portions of the book could be used in college-level courses such as the following: theatre or film sound design and production digital music production a course covering sound in a New Media or Digital Media or Digital Arts program (particularly in programs that are interdisciplinary between computer science and music) a computer science course introducing digital signal processing a computer science course which engages students in programming through audio applications The special value of this book is that it provides a broad context for students. In academic programs that emphasize applications, students are still able to {"}look under the hood{"} to have a deeper understanding of audio processing at a lower level of abstraction. For students of computer science, physics, or mathematics, the relationship between science and applications provides interest and motivation. The book also serves as a reference for anyone interested in digital audio processing. This includes hobbyists, those who are {"}self-taught{"} in music production, and even those already in the audio processing or music production industry who want a deeper understanding of their art and craft.},
